Heliactyl is a powerful, feature-rich client area for the Pterodactyl Panel, designed to enhance user experience and server management capabilities. It allows your users to create, manage, and customize their game servers - powered with Heliactyl's in-house coin-based economy system for resource upgrades.

## Important

Heliactyl Next introduces breaking changes to the configuration system. The `settings.json` or `config.toml` format is no longer supported, previous `heliactyl.db` files are not compatible as well.

- **Server Management**: Create, edit, and delete game servers
- **Server Console, Files & more**: Completely replace your Pterodactyl Panel and users will only need Heliactyl
- **Resource Economy**: Built-in coin system for server upgrades
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern, responsive design built with TailwindCSS
- **API Integration**: Comprehensive API for external integrations
- **High Performance**: Optimized for scalability and speed
